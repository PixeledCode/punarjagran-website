								<p>In the starting, I was wondering how the pandemic and the lockdown has affected the
									people of that strata. I was taken aback by how it has affected them leading to
									homeless life, living without adequate food and then without education too. As I was
									a part of the Whatsapp group of the NGO, I saw a few activities that were taken up
									at the Punar Jagran Samiti during the time of pandemic and lockdown, that works for
									upliftment of under-privileged children, they taught them basic education, provided
									free food to the under-privileged senior citizens and empowering women to help them
									be independent and earn living. </p><br>
								<p>They were eager to learn any and everything by learning every other small thing that
									might help them secure a better future. The Children who were there, were very
									enthusiastic to learn about numbers, basic sciences and computers. I had been
									ignorant about many things and taken them for granted in my life, but now I can
									appreciate my life more and strive to help those in need. </p> <br>
